this code requires maya to be using python ver 2.7 (wont work on 3)


To run Maya 2022 in Python 2, you can do one of followings:

1.Start Maya with "-pythonver" flag.  For python2, it is "maya.exe -pythonver 2".
2.Set environment variable MAYA_PYTHON_VERSION=2 and start Maya. (this only works as long as you don't have environment variable MAYA_NO_CONSOLE_WINDOW set on your machine.)
